running ```rm run && fasm code.s run && chmod +x run && gdb ./run ``` and viewing value of register EAX gives the correct value - however, I have no idea how to print it

special thanks to [ian](https://klatz.co/ctf-blog/how-to-write-shellcode-using-fasm) for taking the time to help me mess around with assembly
